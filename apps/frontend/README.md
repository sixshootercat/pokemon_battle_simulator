## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

## Optimizations and other considerations

1. Improve error handling
2. Improve loading states
3. Improve responsiveness
4. Use react query to simplify server state management
5. Break down large UIs into smaller more manageable components
6. Create resusable components for button, dropdown select, etc
